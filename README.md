# Rubber Ring - simple CMS

Named by The Smiths [song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpf6gJU3520).

## About

This CMS helps you build editable pages fast. You define which content (`image`, `text`, `html`) should be editable for your users. Limitation, that only developer sets what page parts are editable is good for keeping the design intact.

### This CMS is not good for
sites, where editor wants to create new pages and control each part of every page.

## Used software
*Current software prerequisites; made with*

* Ruby `2.0.0-p0`
* Rails 4.0.0.beta1
* Postgres 9.1 with `hstore`
* imagemagick

## Setup

### <a id="deps"></a>Dependencies
To install `hstore` and `imagemagick` on `Ubuntu`
	
	sudo apt-get install postgresql-contrib
	sudo apt-get install imagemagick

### Setting up new Rails project
Create new rails project and add this to `Gemfile` and run `bundle`

	gem 'rubber_ring', :git => 'git://github.com/zigomir/rubber_ring.git'

Create/migrate database

    sudo -u postgres psql your_db_dev -c 'create extension hstore;'
    rake rubber_ring:install:migrations
    rake db:migrate

Add this route to your `routes.rb`

    mount RubberRing::Engine => '/rubber_ring', :as => 'rubber_ring'

Update `development.rb` and `production.rb` files with this two lines

	config.action_controller.perform_caching = true
  	config.action_controller.page_cache_directory = "#{Rails.root.to_s}/public/build"

### Setup config files
Generate password file for admin and settings for publishing pages on production server

	rails generate rubber_ring:install

This will generate

	app/config/publish.yml
	app/config/initializers/rubber_ring.rb

Set admin password in `app/config/initializers/rubber_ring.rb` file and remote production server in `app/config/publish.yml`.

# Usage
## Developers

Rails generator for new pages

    rails generate rubber_ring:page home action1 action2

This will create files and new routes to `routes.rb` file

    create app/controllers/home_controller.rb
    create app/views/home/action1.html.erb
    create app/views/home/action2.html.erb
    route get 'home/action1'
    route get 'home/action2'

### Rubber Ring helpers

CMS fields are made of tag, key and `@page` which holds content for all the page keys/value pairs.

Examples

	<%= editable_image({key: 'header_image', src: '/assets/baws.jpg', height: '360'}, @page) %>

	<%= editable_field(:h1, {key: 'header'}, @page) do %>
	  Welcome to Rubber Ring - CMS that doesn't make you think about it.
	<% end %>

	<%= editable_field(:div, {key: 'first_content', class: 'multi-line'}, @page) do %>
	  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit, sed diam nonummy nibh euismod tincidunt ut
	<% end %>

	<%= duplicable_editable_field(:ul, {group: 'blog_posts', child_tag: 'li', class: 'multi-line'}, @page) do %>
	  i am so alone, no one is wrapping me
	  <h3>i'm hanging with h3, i'm more important and cooler than you are</h3>
	  <span>i'm wrapped in a span element</span>
	<% end %>

### Helper options

Each helper need's to specify unique `key`. These are holding values in the database. Also each helper needs to include `@page` object as their last parameter. This object holds all the page's editable content in a hash data structure.

#### Already used keys which you must **not** use

- `page_title`

#### helper arguments for all editable fields
- `key` unique key to hold the value
- `class` html class attribute (optional)
	- class value with `multi-line` will enable editing in multi lines
- `id` html id attribute (optional)
- `@page` object for holding page content

#### specific arguments for each field
- `editable_image`
	- `src` image source attribute
	- `width` image width
	- `height` image height
- `editable_field`
	- no specific arguments
- `duplicable_editable_field`
	- `group` is used to specify group's key prefix. Example: `grup: blog_posts` will produce keys `blog_posts_1`, `blog_posts_2`, `blog_posts_3`, ... based on how many duplication user will do
	- `child_tag` will set tag for child elements of `duplicable_editable_field`

### Assets (stylesheets and javascripts)

You can use, like in any other new Rails application, [Sprockets directives](https://github.com/sstephenson/sprockets#the-directive-processor) to include assets to your app. Please remove `//= require jquery` and `//= require jquery_ujs` from `application.js` because `rubber ring` is already including `jquery` which you can reuse in your pages as well.

## Editors

Login (`/rubber_ring`) with password which was set by developer in the install stage.

Editing content is easy as clicking inside green boxes and start editing. Some fields can be duplicated with a double mouse click and removed with middle mouse click. Developer decides what can be duplicable/repeatable and what not.

For changing images click on `Image manager` in the upper menu. Drag&Drop the image you need to drop zone. After uploading the image you can drag and drop it on the image you wanted to change. Image will be automatically resized to the size that was set by developer or page designer.

## Build and publish your pages

`Preview` option in the menu will output entire page to `public/build` directory. `Publish` will also build current page and it will also upload it to your production server.

## So this is OK for static HTML sites, what about dynamic ones?
You can of course integrate Rubber Ring with your Rails application as well and use it only for site content editing. But then you won't need `preview` and `publish` features.

## Philosophy

* you can not build robust system without limitations
* system may stretch only to certain point until it breaks. Like a rubber ring!

## Benefits

- optimized for developers and quick setup
- simple to use for customers. True WSYIWYG.
- customer doesn't need application server and/or database. Only plain web server for static HTML serving.
