# TODO
- way to cache all pages in one step and publish them all
- release gem after project is doing ok on at least one project
	- use [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/)

## Future / neat features
- publish on specific time [cool lib for timepicking](http://amsul.ca/pickadate.js)
- use shadow dom for encapsulating application menu [link](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webcomponents/shadowdom/) or even better, use [polymer](http://polymer-project.appspot.com/)
- better GUI design (responsive menu)
