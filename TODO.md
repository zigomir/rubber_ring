# TODO
- don't show saved button when reloading page(s)
- ajax for adding/removing templates (add new action to cms_controller)
- reset images
- remove data attributes from final markup
- multiple template helper on same page
- template GUI as drop down menu
- release gem after at least one live project
	- use [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/)

# Should
- pm save should take content + key for more consistent API
- better way for handling attachments for different languages
    - maybe each language should not have different directory for storing them...
- way to cache all pages in one step and publish them all
	- save path in page table and make crawler that goes through all of them

## Future / neat features
- publish on specific time [cool lib for timepicking](http://amsul.ca/pickadate.js)
- use shadow dom for encapsulating application menu [link](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webcomponents/shadowdom/) or even better, use [polymer](http://polymer-project.appspot.com/)
	- [web components](http://www.webcomponentsshift.com)
- better GUI design (responsive menu)
