# TODOs

## Must
- set page title through RR menu
- set image size in markup and than maintain it whenever new image is dragged on it
- images resize with imagemagick
	- disable dragging bigger images on smaller
- publish build to server
- GOOD DEMO! Spr√ºngli maybe with usage of gem
- release gem
- test fresh rails app with this gem (+ test config.action_controller.page_cache_directory)
- nice tutorial (game like)

## Should
- better and more consistent naming conventions
- duplicable order change
- integration tests with phantom js driver
- Write (JavaScript) tests!
- minify assets with grunt from build script

## Could
- generator for public assets (for now just `all.css` and `main.js`)
- figure out how to move `actionpack-page_caching` dependency to gem only
